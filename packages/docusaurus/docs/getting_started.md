Create Full Stack (CFS) generates a boilerplate Todo app for you, integrating the tools you select. It provides the glue between the libraries and frameworks. No more stitching together random blog posts guessing about best practices. Build scalable applications on a solid foundation. CFS works on macOS, and Linux.

## Prerequisites

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#global-install) >= v1.12.0
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) >= 1.25.5
- Node ^12.10 || 14.x
  - You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to switch Node versions

Check versions:

```bash
yarn --version
docker-compose --version
node --version
```

:::note
CFS support for `npm` will be added when [npm v7](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/626173315965468672/npm-v7-series-beta-release-and-semver-major) is stable, which contains the required [workspaces feature](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0026-workspaces.md).

## Run

```bash
yarn create full-stack my-full-stack
```

**Follow the instructions generated in `my-full-stack/development.html` to complete the setup.** Then try spinning up the full stack locally.

```bash
cd my-full-stack
yarn start
```

## Development URLs

`yarn start` brings up the development stack locally. The following URLs are available if the given services are selected.

- web: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- mobile (expo devtools): [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002)
- backend (hasura): [http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql](http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql)
- backend (apollo-server-express): [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql)

:::caution
If [auth](/docs/auth) is enabled, expect:

- A redirect to your [Auth0 login page](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login) from web
- An authorization error from the backend APIs
